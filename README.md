---
The point of this exercise is to demonstrate understanding of git remotes and git push in Git in addition to utilizing Github capabilities. The following commands were used:

* git remote add *remote-name* *url*
* git remote -v
* git push *remote* *branch*
* git push -u *origin* *branch*

1. Create a new repository locally on your machine.
2. Create a new Github repository. Name it whatever you want. *NOTE: Was named "Whatever_You_Want" before being changed to Github_Basics for further clarity.
3. Connect your local repo to the Github repo.
4. Optional: rename the default branch from master to main.
5. Make a new file called `favorites.txt`  Leave it empty. Make your first commit on the `main` branch.
6. Push up your `main` branch to Github! Make sure you see your empty `favorites.txt` file on Github.
7. Next, create two branches: `foods` and `movies`
8. Switch to the `foods` branch.  Add three (or more) of your favorite foods to the `favorites.txt` file.  Add and commit your changes on the `foods` branch.
9. Switch to the `movies` branch and add three or more of your favorite movies to the `favorites.txt` file.  Add and commit your changes on the movies branch.
10. Push up your `foods` branch to Github. Make sure you see it on Github!
11. Push up your `movies` branch to Github.  Make sure you see it on Github!
12. Merge the `foods` branch into the `main` branch.  Then merge the `movies` branch into the `main` branch.  If necessary, resolve conflicts so that you end up with your favorite foods and favorite movies in the same `favorites.txt` file. 
13. Push up the latest work on your `main` branch to Github.
